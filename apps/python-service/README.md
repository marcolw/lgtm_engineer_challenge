# Python Demo Service (python-lgtm-service)

This is the final, worker-tier service in the LGTM demo chain. It executes the final task (a mock data write) and generates logs.

## 🛠️ Telemetry Setup (Manual Instrumentation)

This service uses the OpenTelemetry Python SDK.
1.  **Context:** It extracts the trace context from the incoming request (passed by the Go service).
2.  **Logging:** Logs generated by the service are configured to automatically inject the active Trace ID and Span ID, allowing for logs and traces to be correlated in Loki and Tempo via Grafana.
